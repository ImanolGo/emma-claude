Based on the provided camera image, with:
Command: {command}
Vehicle History: {history}

Please analyze this driving scene and provide:

1. Brief scene description (weather, road type, traffic conditions)

2. List all critical objects with their positions as (x,y) coordinates relative to the ego vehicle, including:
   - Distance and direction
   - Movement direction if applicable
   - Potential interactions with ego vehicle

3. Explain your reasoning for trajectory planning:
   - Traffic rules that apply
   - Safety considerations
   - Interaction with other road users
   - Any special circumstances

4. Provide a trajectory as 6 (x,y) coordinates at 0.5s intervals, representing a safe path for the next 3 seconds.

Format your response as a JSON object with these exact keys:
{
    "scene_description": "string",
    "critical_objects": [
        {
            "type": "string",
            "position": [x, y],
            "velocity": [vx, vy]
        }
    ],
    "reasoning": "string",
    "trajectory": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...]
}

Ensure all coordinates are in meters and formatted to 2 decimal places.
